    <h3>Understanding</h3>
    <p>The Roots are the heart and backbone, because they anchor the plant 
        to the soil while pumping nutrients up the Stem to the rest of its parts.
        The Stem is the main conductor of nutrients that plants recieve from water,
        the soil and the sun. Also, conducting the release waste from excess heat 
        through the leaves. In addition to releasing of waste, the leaves absorb the 
        nutrients of the sun while help to regulate the plant temperature. The Flowers 
        or Fruits of plant are its' means of reproduction through pollination and its' 
        seeds.
