    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Plants must be provided with every element in the list above. 
           They will need just the right amount of water depending on the 
           contitions of the environment and the specific needs of each plant.
           The right amount of space will always be "more space" if it 
           continues to grow, or "just enough" to not be crowded if it has fully 
           developed. Most plants need at least a couple of hours of sunlight.
           Nurtrient dense soil will give plants a strong foundation from which
           to continue expanding.
