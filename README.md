### HTML Practice

This is a template that I started to build for my self. 
I hoped to use it as a guide for growing plants, so that I could come back to it and update it as I learned more.

It could be useful to for myself and others to build on top the ***simple*** HTML file and practice the tri-fecta of web developement languages.

I will come back and update the files, as to represent my understanding of software developement and my connection to plants.
